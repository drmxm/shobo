Here’s the clean n’ certain way to nuke the current container and rebuild/run it fresh.

### 1) Stop & remove the old container

```bash
docker compose stop perception || true
docker compose rm -f -s -v perception
```

### 2) (Optional but recommended) drop build cache

```bash
docker builder prune -af
```

### 3) Rebuild from scratch

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache perception
```

### 4) (Fix X11 auth before starting – your logs showed “Authorization required”)

On the **host** (Jetson), allow root-in-container to talk to your X server:

```bash
xhost +local:root
# if DISPLAY isn't set on host, you may also need:
export DISPLAY=:0
```

### 5) Run the freshly built service

* Detached:

```bash
docker compose up -d --no-build perception
```

* Attached (see logs live):

```bash
docker compose up --no-build perception
```

### 6) Tail logs (handy for first boot)

```bash
docker compose logs -f perception
```

---

#### Notes on the earlier errors (so they don’t bite again)

* `Authorization required` → fixed by the `xhost +local:root` step above.
* CSI GStreamer “appsink not found / pipeline not created” → make sure your CSI path uses `nvarguscamerasrc` and ends with `appsink` (your node likely already does this; X11 auth failure can cascade into OpenCV/GStreamer errors).
* UVC OpenCV `setSize s >= 0` → this often happens when the first grabbed frame is empty. After the rebuild, if it still appears, try reseating the USB cam or test inside the container:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it shobo-perception bash
  gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video1 ! videoconvert ! fakesink -v
  gst-launch-1.0 nvarguscamerasrc sensor-id=0 ! 'video/x-raw(memory:NVMM),width=1280,height=720,framerate=30/1' ! nvvidconv ! videoconvert ! fakesink -v
  ```

Ping me if you want a quick “healthcheck” script to auto-test `/dev/video*`, Argus, and X access inside the container.
